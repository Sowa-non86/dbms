23) Consider the following DB
Emp(ename.street,city)
Workstenmac.cname.sal)
Company(cname.city)
Managertename,mname)

Implement the following SQL queries

1.Find all companies located in every city in which company "FBC" is located.

3.Find those companies whose employees earn a higher salary, on average, than the 
average salary at FBC 

4.Find all the employees who work in companies located in "Pune

6. Create a trigger which will update the salary of all employees other than manager with 8 % of their salary and for manager 9% of their salary.


-- 1. Creating Tables

-- Table: Emp
CREATE TABLE Emp (
    ename VARCHAR(100),
    street VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    sal DECIMAL(10, 2),
    tename VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Table: Work
CREATE TABLE Work (
    cname VARCHAR(100),
    sal DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Table: Company
CREATE TABLE Company (
    cname VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Table: Manager
CREATE TABLE Manager (
    tename VARCHAR(100),
    mname VARCHAR(100),
    sal DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- 2. Inserting Sample Data

-- Insert sample data into Emp
INSERT INTO Emp (ename, street, city, sal, tename) VALUES 
('Emp1', 'Street1', 'Pune', 50000.00, 'Manager1'),
('Emp2', 'Street2', 'Mumbai', 60000.00, 'Manager1'),
('Emp3', 'Street3', 'Pune', 70000.00, 'Manager2');

-- Insert sample data into Work
INSERT INTO Work (cname, sal) VALUES 
('FBC', 80000.00),
('XYZ', 90000.00),
('ABC', 100000.00);

-- Insert sample data into Company
INSERT INTO Company (cname, city) VALUES 
('FBC', 'Pune'),
('XYZ', 'Mumbai'),
('ABC', 'Pune');

-- Insert sample data into Manager
INSERT INTO Manager (tename, mname, sal) VALUES 
('Manager1', 'ManagerA', 120000.00),
('Manager2', 'ManagerB', 130000.00);


-- 1. Find all companies located in every city in which company "FBC" is located.
SELECT cname
FROM Company
WHERE city IN (
    SELECT city
    FROM Company
    WHERE cname = 'FBC'
);

-- 3. Find those companies whose employees earn a higher salary, on average, than the average salary at FBC.
SELECT c.cname
FROM Company AS c
JOIN Emp AS e ON c.city = e.city
GROUP BY c.cname
HAVING AVG(e.sal) > (
    SELECT AVG(w.sal)
    FROM Work AS w
    JOIN Company AS c2 ON w.cname = c2.cname
    WHERE c2.cname = 'FBC'
);

-- 4. Find all the employees who work in companies located in "Pune".
SELECT ename
FROM Emp
WHERE city = 'Pune';

-- 6. Create a trigger which will update the salary of all employees other than managers with 8% of their salary and for managers 9% of their salary.
